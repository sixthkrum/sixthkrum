Education

Professional Experience
----------

July 2024 - Present: **Senior Software Engineer -  Backend** at Advantage Club

July 2022 - July 2024: **Software Engineer - Backend** at Advantage Club

January 2022 - July 2022: **Intern - Backend** at Advantage Club

Projects worked on at Advantage Club (used **Ruby** for everything unless specified otherwise):

- Single-handedly designed and built the backend of a no-code framework for end-user supplied expressions. Features: expression input as a list of JSON objects, type and syntax checking, support for parallel computation of unrelated nodes and ability to use multiple types of input expressions with the same core framework.
- Suggested, designed and implemented with a junior developer the movement of scheduled mailing tasks from a low visibility Rufus Scheduler based system to a **Sidekiq** based system with high visibility and good error reporting. **Reduced incident response time and number of incidents** while increasing resources used minimally.
- Single-handedly designed and built another domain-specific no-code framework for a rewards and recognition product's nomination module. Broke down the flow into manageable parts and gave developers the provision to be able to define the behaviour of the part through a JSON based configuration using whitelisted pre-defined methods. **Reduced the testing and development cost** for new nomination flows (most of our clients have flows that are composable from parts of the flows of other clients, everything is still logically separated tenant (client) wise)
- Single-handedly designed and built a no-code framework for certificate generator (through a JSON configuration) with support for dynamic text placement, automatic multiline placement, dynamic style (including different styles in same line) and multiple alignments, dynamic resizing using ImageMagick (without pango or html. Developers had to input pixel coordinates, I did so to allow for better control. It was only used to style text and place text at the generated coordinates)
- Single-handedly designed and implemented a **Slack integration** for our rewards and recognition product. Interactive forms and pages with per-client customisations and mirroring of posts.
- Single-handedly designed and implemented a platform agnostic chatbot framework with pre-defined decision trees based on user input and used it for a **Whatsapp integration** of our rewards and recognition product.
- Implemented a **Blender** script using **Python** for automated generation of gifs depicting virtual award reception with dynamic models.
- **Reported and mitigated** various security-related issues on an ad-hoc basis
- **Created dev tools to help increase the productivity of the team**:
    - string regex across git repositories and branches
    - automatic Github pull request creator for urgent patches
    - simple dummy data creator
    - fast automated (updated from manual) compression of frontend-related artifacts during deployment with cache busting using GNU parallel
